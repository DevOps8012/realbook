Steps to make the real book using latex:

1) First copy over the `images` folder from leanpub repo
from `leanpub/manuscript` to `realbook/out`

2) Remove the images associated with the title to save space:

images/1477*
images/title_page*

3) Run the following bash scripts:

make_md_figs
make_assess
make_tex
make_wrapper

4) Try to build a PDF:

cd out
pdflatex wrapper.tex

5) Search the PDF file for "## Error"
